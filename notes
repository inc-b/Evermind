Use Wolfenstein style 3d rendering to turn the 2d maps into traversable environments (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOCQfxRQ2pY)

NOTES
- Base wall height can be changed according to location and a noise map can add or remove some height for organic variation. Further variation possible by adjusting the length of each line drawn. Fast, repeatable methods needed for each.
- Floor/ground and ceiling/sky colour set by location.
- Fogging will be needed so there's a maximum draw distance. Is exponential or linear fall off best? Fog level should change per location

ROADMAP
- Sky/ceiling and ground/floor textures
- Wall textures. Procedural generation is probably not a good idea but each location would need multiple textures and a procedural way to apply them, which is a huge amount of work
- Can walls be shaped using marching squares so the map isn't so blocky?
