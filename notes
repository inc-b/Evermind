Use Wolfenstein style 3d rendering to turn the 2d maps into traversable environments
- Base wall height can be changed according to location and a noise map can add or remove some height for organic variation
- Floor/ground and ceiling/sky colour set by location
- Can walls be shaped using marching squares so the map isn't so blocky?
